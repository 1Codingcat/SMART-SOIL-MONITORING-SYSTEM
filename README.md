# SMART-SOIL-MONITORING-SYSTEM
Designed and developed a smart agriculture system using Raspberry Pi Pico W and multiple sensors (NPK, DHT11, OLED) to monitor key soil parameters. Programmed MicroPython in Thonny to collect real-time data and transmit it via Wi-Fi to Google Sheets. Implemented logic to analyze soil nutrient levels and recommend suitable crops.
